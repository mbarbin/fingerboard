(*_ Notice: The unified-diff renderer and the [Equal] / [Line] / [compute] API
  shape in this file were vendored from windtrap (the [Myers] module,
  [lib/myers/myers.mli]) as documented in [vendor.json] and the project's root
  [NOTICE.md]. Only the shortest-edit-script computation was replaced (it now
  lives in [merge3.mli], vendored from gazagnaire/ocaml-merge3); the rendering
  logic — [type hunk], [lines_of_string], [hunks_of_lines], [diff],
  [print_diff] — derives from windtrap.

  List of changes relative to windtrap:

  - Applied local project ocamlformat (janestreet profile).
  - [compute] delegates to the vendored {!Merge3.diff}.
  - Hunk lines use the [Line] variant instead of windtrap's [(char * string)]
    encoding ([type hunk.lines : string Line.t list]).
  - [lines_of_string] returns a [string list] and the intermediate [Array]
    representation in [hunks_of_lines] was removed.
  - Diff rendering tweaks: line prefixes are ["-|"] / ["+|"] / ["  "], and the
    [--- / +++] header is emitted only when a label is explicitly provided
    (windtrap always emitted it with the defaults "expected" / "actual"). *)

(** Unified-diff renderer built on a vendored Myers shortest-edit-script.

    The renderer is vendored from windtrap; the shortest-edit-script
    computation is vendored from gazagnaire/ocaml-merge3 (kept as a private
    [Merge3] module). See [myers.ml], [merge3.ml] and the root [NOTICE.md] for
    provenance and the list of changes. *)
