(* Notice: this file is a partial vendor of gazagnaire/ocaml-merge3
   ([lib/merge3.ml]), imported pristine at the revision recorded in
   [vendor.json] and then trimmed to the surface this project uses.
   ocamlformat is disabled in this directory ([.ocamlformat-ignore]) so that
   what remains stays byte-comparable with that revision.

   Upstream's copyright block and module header are kept as they stand, and
   so describe the whole of the upstream module rather than this trimmed
   copy.

   Removed: [lcs]; the diff3 3-way merge ([merge], [to_string],
   [has_conflicts] and [conflicts], the [conflict], [merged_chunk] and [t]
   types, and their machinery); [pp], the only user of the [fmt] dependency;
   and the Irmin-style merge combinators ([result], [f], [default],
   [option], [pair], [alist]).

   Changed: [myers_forward] ends its search on its own [Myers_done]
   exception rather than [Stdlib.Exit], which an [eq] that itself raises
   [Exit] would be caught by. *)

(** {1 Myers' O(ND) Diff Algorithm}

    E. W. Myers, "An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and Its Variations",
    Algorithmica 1(2), 1986, pp. 251–266.

    The algorithm finds the shortest edit script (SES) between two sequences. It
    works by computing the furthest-reaching D-paths for increasing edit
    distances D = 0, 1, 2, ... The key insight is that diagonal k = x - y
    represents a state where x characters from [a] and y from [b] have been
    consumed, and only even/odd diagonals are reachable at each step.

    Time: O(ND) where N = |a| + |b| and D = edit distance. Space: O(D²) for the
    trace (one V-array per step). *)

(** Compute the furthest-reaching D-paths.

    Records snapshots of the active V range [-d..d] (size 2d+1) at each step
    instead of the full V array (size 2*max_d+1). This is the standard Myers
    space optimisation: at step d only diagonals -d..d are reachable, so the
    rest of V is unused. The trace becomes O(D²) instead of O(D*N), which is a
    substantial win when D ≪ N (typical for incremental edits).

    Returns [(D, trace)] where [trace.(d)] is an array of length [2*d+1] indexed
    by [k+d] (so trace.(d).(0) holds V[-d], trace.(d).(2*d) holds V[d]). *)
