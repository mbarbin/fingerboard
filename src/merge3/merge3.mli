(*_ Notice: this file is a partial vendor of gazagnaire/ocaml-merge3
  ([lib/merge3.mli]), imported pristine at the revision recorded in
  [vendor.json] and then trimmed to the surface this project uses.
  ocamlformat is disabled in this directory ([.ocamlformat-ignore]) so that
  what remains stays byte-comparable with that revision.

  Upstream's copyright block and module header are kept as they stand, and
  so describe the whole of the upstream module rather than this trimmed
  copy.

  Removed: [lcs]; the 3-way merge section ([merge], [has_conflicts],
  [to_string], [conflicts] and [pp], and the [conflict], [merged_chunk] and
  [t] types); and the Irmin-style merge combinators ([result], [f],
  [default], [option], [pair], [alist]). *)

(** Textbook 3-way merge algorithms.

    [Merge3] computes the shortest edit script between two sequences, and merges
    two derived versions of a text against their common ancestor.

    {2:algorithms Algorithms}

    {b Myers diff.} The shortest edit script between two sequences in O(ND)
    time, where N is the total length and D the edit distance. Near-linear for
    similar inputs.

    {i E. W. Myers, "An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and Its Variations",
       Algorithmica 1(2), 1986, pp. 251-266.}

    {b diff3 merge.} Given a common ancestor (base) and two derived versions, a
    merged result or conflict markers.

(** The type for edit operations in a shortest edit script. *)
type 'a edit =
  | Keep of 'a  (** Element present in both sequences. *)
  | Delete of 'a  (** Element present in the old sequence, absent in the new. *)
  | Insert of 'a  (** Element absent in the old sequence, present in the new. *)

val diff : eq:('a -> 'a -> bool) -> 'a array -> 'a array -> 'a edit list
(** [diff ~eq a b] is the shortest edit script transforming [a] into [b], by
    Myers' O(ND) algorithm, with elements compared by [eq]. It runs in O(ND)
    time for N the sum of the lengths of [a] and [b] and D the edit distance,
    and holds the trace in O(D{^ 2}) space. *)
