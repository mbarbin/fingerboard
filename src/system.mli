type t [@@deriving sexp_of]

(** Display t in the form of multiple tables in a human readable way. *)
val to_ascii_tables : t -> string

(** Instantiate a system with open strings starting from the highest
   vibrating strings, and with open strings following the given
   intervals while going down the instruments. The resulting system is
   set with 1 more string than the length of the array. *)
val create
  :  high_vibrating_string:Note.t
  -> pitch:Frequency.t
  -> intervals_going_down:Characterized_interval.t array
  -> t

(** Reset the pitch from any given string. *)
val reset_pitch : t -> Roman_numeral.t -> pitch:Frequency.t -> unit

val pitch : t -> Fingerboard_location.t -> Frequency.t

(** Returns None if [from] has a higher pitch than [to_]. *)
val acoustic_interval
  :  t
  -> from:Fingerboard_location.t
  -> to_:Fingerboard_location.t
  -> Acoustic_interval.t option

(** Add a new position to the system. A call to this function will
   cause multiple fingerboard locations to be added to the system
   systematically, in particular:

   - the locations that are at the same distance to the open string on
   all other strings;

   - the locations on the same string at higher octaves. By default, 3
   locations on the strings are added, on 3 octaves. This may be
   controlled by the [on_n_octaves] parameter.

   The position's name must be unique within a system, that is a
   fingerboard position with the same name must not have been
   previously added to that system. Because positions are
   systematically added at the octaves of the given string portion,
   the one given as reference for a new position is expected to be
   lower than one octave to the open string. *)
val add_fingerboard_position_exn
  :  ?on_n_octaves:int
  -> t
  -> Fingerboard_position.t
  -> unit

(** Returns the list of fingerboard_positions known by this system, returned in the
   order they are found going up the fingerboard starting from the
   open string. *)
val fingerboard_positions : t -> Fingerboard_position.t list

(** Find the position created with the given name if present or raise.
   The position returned is that of the first octave on the string. *)
val find_fingerboard_position_exn : t -> name:string -> Fingerboard_position.t

(** Check whether given positions and locations are present in the system. *)

val exists_fingerboard_position : t -> Fingerboard_position.t -> bool
val exists_fingerboard_location : t -> Fingerboard_location.t -> bool

val find_next_located_note
  :  t
  -> Located_note.t
  -> Characterized_interval.t
  -> Located_note.t option

(** Return the given located_note if a position was added to the system for the open string. *)
val open_string : t -> Roman_numeral.t -> Located_note.t option

(** Try and go up from the first supplied located note, according to
   the characterized scale supplied. If no available positions are
   available to produce the right intervals, the scales stops and the
   degree built so far are returned. If the degree of the scale have
   all been used before reaching the highest note desired, the same
   scale is reused from that point.

   This function will favor going up on the strings, and play with
   longer vibrating strings rather than using high positions on lower
   strings (when multiple choices exist). *)
val make_scale
  :  t
  -> characterized_scale:Characterized_scale.t
  -> from:Located_note.t
  -> to_:Note.t
  -> Located_note.t list

(** Given a located note, find a position on the lower string next to
   where it is that yields the same note. Returns [None] if such a
   position does not exists, or if the given note is already played on
   the lowest string available. *)
