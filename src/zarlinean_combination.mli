(** When playing a just major scale in double stops of thirds or sixths, each
    pair of notes is expected to form a just interval. Assuming one note is
    extracted from a pythagorean system (noted [p]), the other must then be
    adjusted accordingly. We note [z] a note taken from a just system to be
    tuned with the [p] note.

    Since there are 7 degrees, it follows that for it to work, at least one
    degree must be changed (from [p] to [z] or the opposite) as we go up the
    scale depending on whether it is the low or the high note. So as to limit
    the number of changing degrees, we do not consider solutions to this
    problems with more than 1 changing degree.

    An example of such combination is the following:
    {v
        ┌───┬─────┬─────┬────┬───┬────┬─────┐
        │ I │ II  │ III │ IV │ V │ VI │ VII │
        ├───┼─────┼─────┼────┼───┼────┼─────┤
        │ p │ p,z │ z   │ p  │ p │ z  │ z   │
        └───┴─────┴─────┴────┴───┴────┴─────┘
    v}

    In this example, the changing note is set on the second degree, and is
    played [z] when played with the degree IV, and [p] when played with the
    degree VII.

    This module goes over all such possible theoretical combinations. There are
    displayed in the test for this module. *)
