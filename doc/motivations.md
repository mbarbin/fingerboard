# Motivations

## Programmatic representation

While going over my notes again in 2022 I realized that there were
quite a bit of typos and mistakes in them. One advantage of using a
programmatic representation is that the contents is checked in a
systematic fashion, and while it is possible that there are bugs in
the code, these defects can be flushed out and fixed overtime.

## Comparison with the contents of CelloMind

I was quite impressed by the book and wanted to understand which parts
were new to me, and which were overlapping with information that I had
already been able to gather from other sources.

## Publishing the contents

I figured that I would want sometimes to be able to refer to the
contents of this repo, either for my personal use or in conversations
with cellists or other musicians, as a quick online reference.
