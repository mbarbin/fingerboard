# Roadmap

I don't have a precise plan in mind at the moment, although there are
some aspects that I haven't had a chance to integrate and would like
to, such as showing precisely the acoustic intervals involved in
double stops with the various systems.

There are also some other systems that I'd like to incorporate, while
making the contents more easily understandable by a larger audience.
Please let me know if you have an interest for this repo.
