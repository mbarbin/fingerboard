# A bit of history about the contents

In 2005, I spent a great number of hours practicing double stops on
the cello. As a result, I started researching contents on acoustic
intervals and temperaments, as they relate to intonation. I summarized
some findings and information gathered around that time in some
personal notes, as I was trying to understand, hear and practice the
use of different intonation systems (equal, pythagorean and just).

In the years that followed, I spent less time thinking about this
topic. A few years ago (perhaps 2018) I discovered a book called
CelloMind, by Hans Jorgen Jensen and Minna Rose Chung. The first part
of the book motivated me to revive my notes, and turn them into a
format that I could more easily verify and share. In 2022 I had the
idea of turning them into a piece of software that I could easily
improve over time, and this repo was born.
